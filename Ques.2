# Question: How to write a python function that checks whether a word or phase is a palindrome or not.
# 
# Here's the solution:

def is_palindrome(s):
    """Function to check if a word or phrase is a palindrome."""
    # Remove spaces and convert to lowercase for uniformity
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()
    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    word = "racecar"
    if is_palindrome(word):
        print(f'"{word}" is a palindrome.')
    else:
        print(f'"{word}" is not a palindrome.')
