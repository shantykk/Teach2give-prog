# Question: write a query that will display the results below (Note: some columns might be renamed
but use the column names above). It should only show 2020 data and order by driver
points.
# 
# Here's the solution:

sql
SELECT
    r.race_name,
    r.race_year,
    r.race_date,
    c.circuit_location,
    d.driver_name,
    d.driver_number,
    d.driver_nationality,
    t.name AS team,
    res.grid,
    res.fastest_lap,
    res.race_time,
    res.points
FROM
    results res
JOIN races r ON res.race_id = r.race_id
JOIN drivers d ON res.driver_id = d.driver_id
JOIN constructors t ON res.constructor_id = t.constructor_id
JOIN circuits c ON r.circuit_id = c.circuit_id
WHERE
    r.race_year = 2020
ORDER BY
    res.points DESC;
